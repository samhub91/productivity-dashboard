# Productivity Dashboard

This project is a simple productivity dashboard built using React. It helps you track your tasks, manage notes, count progress, and personalize settings.

## 🧠 What I've Learned

### 🔹 React Fundamentals
- **JSX**: Wrote HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript.
- **Components**: Built modular UI pieces like `Counter`, `TodoList`, `ColorPicker`, and `Settings`.
- **Props and State**: Used `useState` to manage dynamic data like count and tasks.
- **Event Handling**: Connected user interactions (clicks, input) with event handlers.

### 🔹 Routing with React Router
- Navigated between multiple pages (`Dashboard`, `Settings`) using `<Routes>` and `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`.

### 🔹 Conditional Rendering
- Displayed UI conditionally, such as showing completed tasks or not.

### 🔹 Component Reusability and Composition
- Composed the `Dashboard` using multiple smaller functional components.

### 🔹 CSS Styling
- Used inline styles for components and started planning a consistent theme.
